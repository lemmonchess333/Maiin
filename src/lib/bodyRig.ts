/**
 * Body rig — animated exercise demos built from the REAL muscle-map figure.
 *
 * History: stock photos rejected; Gemini frames rejected twice; a hand-drawn
 * side-view rig rejected ("needs to look like THIS" — the muscle map). The
 * final insight: react-body-highlighter ships the professional figure as raw
 * polygon data, so we vendor it (bodyModelData.ts, MIT) and animate THE
 * ACTUAL ART — skeletal limb groups transformed about measured joint pivots.
 * The demo is literally the app's muscle-map body performing the movement,
 * with the working muscles filled in the same purples the Form view uses.
 *
 * Motion language (front/back view, like the reference):
 *  - arms rotate about the measured shoulder/elbow pivots (in-plane);
 *  - squats/hinges read via vertical compression about the knee/hip lines
 *    plus body drop — the standard stylization for frontal anatomy figures;
 *  - Held weights are scoped BY CAMERA, not banned. They were built and
 *    removed on 2026-07-03 (product owner) because "the figure has no
 *    hands, so a held prop always read detached" — which is still true
 *    of the anterior/posterior figure, whose arm chain ends at the
 *    forearm. The profile rig later grew a real `handL` group, and held
 *    gear came back THERE and only there: the deadlift's plate, the
 *    curl's bar, the pushdown's rope. Front and back views still carry
 *    structural equipment only — the bar a pull-up hangs from, the
 *    pulldown cable. Read that decision as scoped, not reversed; the
 *    overhead press declares its bar path and deliberately draws no bar.
 *
 * Props themselves live in `bodyProps.ts` — typed state, one pure
 * resolver, both renderers going through it.
 *
 * Everything is deterministic data → testable, theme-consistent, zero assets.
